The platform is equipped with up-right and inverted fluorescent microscopes, and analysis workstations.

Imaging applications include:

- Real-time visualization of dynamic cellular processes (signaling, intracellular transport, organization of organelles and subcellular structures)
- Single-cell analysis, to visualise cell heterogenity within a population
- Recording of cellular morphological changes or cell death (in response to particular stimuli, damage, stress conditions)
- Measurements of cell migration
- High definition analysis of subcellular structures (5 fluorescence excitation channels, simultaneous visualization of 4 stainings, deconvolution)
- Proximity ligation assays for in situ protein interactions and in situ post-translational modifications.
