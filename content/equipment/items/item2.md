The Nikon Eclipse Ti is an inverted motorized microscope indicated for time-lapse recording of live samples, using DIC (differential interference contrast), Phase Contrast and fluorescence

- completely motorised to perform all functions in automated mode (z-axis, xy stage movement, microscope camera and lamp functions)

- integrated Perfect Focus System (PFS): corrects focus drifts during long-term observations.

- Acquisition software Nis-Elements AR with JOBS module: allows personalized experimental settings, e.g., acquisition intervals, choice of observation fields (multipoint acquisition), fluorescent channels, time exposure, z-axis. Automated and conditioned acquisition workflows can be easily executed

- Okolab stage incubator, allowing prolonged observations (up to 5-6 days)

- Intensilight fluorescence lamp, with six discrete levels of light intensity

- Set of objectives for DIC, Ph, fluorescence

- Filter cubes: DAPI (BFP-A, Semrock), FITC (EX 480/30, BS 505, EM 535/40), TRITC (EX 535/50, BS 575, EM 590LP)

- Digital camera Clara (Andor): cooled monochrome, 1392 x 1040 pixels; 6,45 µm x 6,45 µm pixel size
