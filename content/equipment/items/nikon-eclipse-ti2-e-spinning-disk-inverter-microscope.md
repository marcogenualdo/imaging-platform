Nikon / CrestOptics spinning disk confocal system, designed to deliver high-throughput, simultaneous imaging of high numbers of samples

Last generation Nikon T2 microscope and spinning disk

* Inverted microsope with currently available widest field of view (25 mm): maximizes the area of the camera sensor, significantly increasing the data flow and reducing the time for data acquisition and analysis by 30%; 
* Last generation Perfect Focus System: enables the focal plane of live cells to be maintained for long observation times (e.g. over several days)
* Confocal spinning disk system (CrestOptics V3) with high-efficiency quantum chamber
* Okolab stage incubator, allowing prolonged observations (up to 5-6 days)
* Light: LED sources, with low impact on cell viability for live imaging applications and 7 fluorescence channels, or alternatively laser channels 

Image acquisition and processing

* Automated or manual mode for image acquisition in various dimensions (high content)  
* Nis Advanced Research module for confocal image processing, supporting very high spatial resolution; the Nis-elements AR software with Jobs module enables the handling and analysis of large data in real time
* Automated classification and analysis of imaging data, can support imaging studies at the "omics" level (phenotype profiling, screening projects…) 
* Increased computational level to process high-throughput, high content data based on machine-learning
