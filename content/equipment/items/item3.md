**Nis-Elements HC** software with:

- deconvolution
- creation of image projections from z-stacks using Maximum Intensity Projection, Minimum Intensity Projection, Extended Depth of Focus functions
- 3D visualisation of z-stacks
- manual or automatic (binarization) measures and counting of: geometric features (distances, lengths, areas, etc.), volume measurements, signal intensity (mean, sum, profile), number of objects, colocalization module, measures over time.
- bio-analyses: wound healing assays, proliferation assays, cell tracking, cell count
- elaboration of quantitative data: automatically generated tables and histograms of several measured values, with statistics, easily exported to excel worksheets;
- qualitative elaboration of analysis using LUTs
- easy annotation on images (e.g., associated measured data, labels, scalebars)
