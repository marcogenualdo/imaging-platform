In this study we characterised the role of the Aurora-A kinase and its major regulator TPX2 in the control of mitotic spindle orientation in mammalian cells, a process which determines the position and fate of daughter cells.

Work was collaboratively carried out by groups at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) and at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). Research groups at Sapienza University and at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology (Dortmund, DE) participated to the project.
