Collaborative work between researchers at the IBPM platform and CrestOptics Company allowed the validation of a method for automated imaging and analysis of in vitro 3D breast epithelial acini.Â 

The derived Application Note (<https://crestoptics.com/high-content-imaging-for-morphological-profiling-of-3d-breast-acini/>) describes high-content platforms, based on the CrestOptics X-Light V3 spinning disk, applied to the morphological profiling of 3D breast spheroids derived from the MCF10A cell line.

The imaging system, coupled with Nis Elements Software capable of automating acquisitions and analyses, has made it possible to compare morphological characteristics between normal (MCF10A CTR) and transformed (MCF10A RAS) acini. High content analysis of morphological features such as volume, elongation, sphericity, diameter, and surface demonstrated that acini derived from transformed cells display an alteration of the acinar structure and architecture (see figure).

The combination of high content microscopy with tridimensional cellular models could thus contribute significantly to cancer research, especially in the validation of active molecules in drug screening.
