**Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of commitment towards neuronal differentiation in living pluripotent cells over time**

Neuronal differentiation is a highly complex, multistep process that regulates the determination and specification of neuronal fate, as well as major molecular and functional changes, such as the emergence of neurites and maturation of dendrites and axons. Acquiring a profound knowledge of factors regulating neuronal differentiation is crucial to identify particularly vulnerable windows in which defects or gene mutations can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. This requires capturing the dynamic dimension of the process.  

Here we aimed at imaging neuronal differentiation over time, both in fixed cell cultures and under in vivo conditions, to depict morphological cell changes and appearance of neuronal markers. We first characterized differentiating cell models exposed to classical inducers, i.e. Retinoic Acid (RA) and Neurobasal (NB) Medium. We next selected murine P19 pluripotent cells undergoing differentiation for time-lapse recording (up to 96 h) to follow up in real time their commitment to the neuronal fate. We developed two novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms to perform a high-throughput analysis of the phenotypes elicited during neuronal differentiation.
