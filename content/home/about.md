The platform was first established in 2009 with support from Fondazione Monte Paschi, Fondazione Roma and Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. It has since been supported by two dedicated grants from Regione Lazio and by the CNR Project “Impara - Imaging from Molecules to Preclinical Studies” funded by the Ministry of Education and Research for the development of National research infrastructures.  The platform is hosted at the Department of Biology and Biotechnology “Charles Darwin” of Sapienza University.
