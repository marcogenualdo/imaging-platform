title: Visualizing cell dynamics
---

The IBPM microscopy platform hosts last-generation widefield light microscopy equipment and advanced imaging software for automated image analyses.

It supports versatile applications for both fixed and live cell samples and provides opportunities for coupling dynamic studies (time-lapse recording) with high resolution qualitative and quantitative image analysis.

The Center is open to external users, [click here for access rules](/access).

**Applications**

- Time-lapse recording of cellular processes in live cells over days
- Detecting intracellular molecular interactions
- Reconstructing cellular and subcellular structures at 3D level
- Quantitative analysis of imaging data
