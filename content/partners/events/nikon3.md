This study was developed as a **collaboration between IBPM and Nikon**,

- with the goal to develop and validate methods of **automated image acquisition**
- to detect large numbers of protein interactions in intact cells by **Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)**.

A **whole proteome-wide** analysis of importin beta / karyopherin beta was developed and visualized in human cells.
