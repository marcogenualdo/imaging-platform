**Colorful acini grown in 3D culture**

The three-dimensional (3D) culture of epithelial cells recapitulates numerous features of epithelium in vivo, overcoming monolayer cell growth limitations. Here we show a superresolved image of mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D conditions as part of a collaborative work with [CREST OPTICS](https://crestoptics.com/colorful-acini-grown-in-3d-culture/).
