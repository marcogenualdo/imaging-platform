**Super-resolution microscopy to visualize microtubules and nuclear lamin organization at mitotic exit**

A recent collaborative study has shown that the microtubule-associated protein TPX2 plays an unexpected role in cytoskeleton microtubule (MT) remodeling and nuclear reassembly at the mitosis-to-interphase transition (Naso et al., 2020)
