Collaborative work integrates high-content imaging approaches to define the effects of compounds of innovative design (e.g. based on SAR, molecular modeling of targets, etc.) in cultured cell lines, including ad-hoc engineered cell systems expressing specific markers. Time-lapse videorecording methods are employed to follow up the cellular fates at the single cell-level, with a special focus on cell division, autophagy and cell death as target processes.
