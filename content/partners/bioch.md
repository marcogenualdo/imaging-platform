Collaborations with teams in this Department combine the use of structural biology, proteomics and molecular modeling approaches with microscopy-based techniques. Imaging studies are optimized to define the subcellular localization of specific enzymes, their expression, their interactions with particular organelles, as well as protein-protein interactions in intact cells in situ. Chemical inhibitors of protein function or interaction with their partners are also validated in imaging studies at the platform.
