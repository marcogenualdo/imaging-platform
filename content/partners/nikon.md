Imaging data can complement information obtained by “Omics” Sciences. Collaborations with Nikon specialists are ongoing to develop methods for image segmentation, automatic acquisition and classification that improve large-scale imaging data analysis (signal screening and quantification, classification of cellular morphology and/or subcellular structures etc.).
