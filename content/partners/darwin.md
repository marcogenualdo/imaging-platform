The imaging platform is hosted within the Department of Biology and Biotechnology of Sapienza University (“San Lorenzo” compound), strengthening the collaboration between BBCD and IBPM research teams and offering opportunities for adapting imaging methods to a variety of model systems, ranging from bacterial species to yeast, drosophila and mice tissues, as well as multiple mammalian models of cell division and differentiation.
