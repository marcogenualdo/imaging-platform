The IBPM Imaging platform is a node of the IMPARA project, funded by the MUR (Ministry of University of Research)-PON programme to implement the National bioimaging infrastructure. The reference European infrastructure is EuroBioImaging. IMPARA is designed to implement cutting-edge technologies in biological (microscopy) and preclinical biomedical imaging in several nodes nationwide.
