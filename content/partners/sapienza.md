**[Department of Biochemical Sciences "A. Rossi Fanelli"](https://dsb.uniroma1.it/)**

Collaborations with teams in this Department combine the use of structural biology, proteomics and molecular modeling approaches with microscopy-based techniques. Imaging studies are optimized to define the subcellular localization of specific enzymes, their expression, their interactions with particular organelles, as well as protein-protein interactions in intact cells in situ. Chemical inhibitors of protein function or interaction with their partners are also validated in imaging studies at the platform.

The imaging platform is hosted within the Department of Biology and Biotechnology of Sapienza University (“San Lorenzo” compound), strengthening the collaboration between BBCD and IBPM research teams and offering opportunities for adapting imaging methods to a variety of model systems, ranging from bacterial species to yeast, drosophila and mice tissues, as well as multiple mammalian models of cell division and differentiation.

Collaborative work integrates high-content imaging approaches to define the effects of compounds of innovative design (e.g. based on SAR, molecular modeling of targets, etc.) in cultured cell lines, including ad-hoc engineered cell systems expressing specific markers. Time-lapse videorecording methods are employed to follow up the cellular fates at the single cell-level, with a special focus on cell division, autophagy and cell death as target processes.
